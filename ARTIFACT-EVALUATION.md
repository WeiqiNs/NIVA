Requested Badge: **Available**

## Description
The artifacts implement the proposed PEAR protocol, which combines FLPCP from [Boneh et al. (2019)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/188.pdf) and unrestricted IPFE from [Castagnos et al. (2018)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/791.pdf).  
Additionally, the repository includes benchmarking code for two other off-the-shelf NIVA protocols: one based on Bulletproofs and additive homomorphic encryption, and the other combining FLPCP with fully homomorphic encryption.
